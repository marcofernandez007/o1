# o1
Simplified "o1" Framework

This is a Python implementation of a simplified framework inspired by the "o1" roadmap. This example focuses on reinforcement learning principles using policy initialization, reward design, and a search strategy.

We'll use PyTorch to define a reinforcement learning environment where the policy is a neural network, and the reward design incorporates outcome-based rewards. For simplicity, this example represents a token-level search task where the agent learns to generate sequences similar to a target.


# Explanation:
Environment (TextGenerationEnv):

Defines a simple text generation task where the agent generates a target sequence (e.g., "hello").
Each action corresponds to a character from the vocabulary.
Policy Network:

A GRU-based policy model predicts the next token in the sequence.
Outputs a probability distribution over the vocabulary for the next action.
Training Loop:

# Implements the REINFORCE algorithm (policy gradient).
The agent interacts with the environment, collects rewards, and updates its policy using discounted cumulative rewards.
Reward Design:

Outcome reward: Positive if the generated sequence matches the target; otherwise, penalizes small mistakes.
Next Steps:
Enhance Search: Implement tree search or beam search for generating sequences during inference.
Reward Shaping: Replace outcome rewards with process rewards for intermediate steps.
Scaling: Extend the environment to handle longer sequences and multi-step reasoning tasks.
